                    <p>    
                    <br><br>
                    Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 24, 2002. At the age of one, <br>
                    my family moved to Laredo, Texas where I was raised with my brother.  <br><br>
                    
                    Growing up, I always had a passion for coding from my father showing <br>
                    me at such a young age. Following this passion, I participated in my <br>
                    school's robotics club every year as a programmer, starting since first <br>
                    grade. I grew up with the FIRST program, which is a robotics organization <br>
                    prioritizing in teaching young adults with passions in STEM to become <br>
                    leaders and developing teamwork, while at the same time honing their skills. <br>
                    After 11 years of this program, I can proudly say that I have the skills of <br>
                    teamwork, leadership, and knowledge of programming, with accolades on a <br>
                    national level as proof.<br><br>
                    Currently, I am a sophomore the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a <br>
                    Bachelors of Science degree for Computer Science. In my downtime, I enjoy <br>
                    playing basketball, playing video games, and watching movies. <br>
